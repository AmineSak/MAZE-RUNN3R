# MAZE-RUNN3R

## Proximal Policy Optimization

This repo contains an implementation of the foundational reinforcement learning algorithm PPO based on the paper presented by OpenAI titled [Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347).
Although this implementation is mainly intended to train an agent to solve mazes efficiently, it can be adapted to train other agents of the Gym environments.
